# Future Development

The BOC platform is a disruptive innovation that aims to change the ecosystem revolving around crypto investment industries. It will be the bridge between ecosystems for fund lenders and investment vehicle operators alike. As BOC becomes widely integrated and adopted, the next step for the BOC team will be to continue the expansion and adoption of new algo into the broader usage, and thereby creating a truly new and connected crypto investment world.

## DAO Development

Currently, governance functions are approved via a multisig smart contract controlled by the BlockBank team. Users need to trust the BlockBank team not to abuse administrative functions. This trust requirement will exist until governance rights are transferred to a DAO which is planned for a later iteration based on the following direction:

1) Using Snapshot for off-chain voting, and contracts are executed on-chain.

2) The issuance contract of governance tokens is under development.

The innovative protocol will be followed by a smart DAO organization combining lenders own digital asset marketplace to further maximize the influence thus reward from the market. Further down the road, BOC plans on expanding into other sectors, including hedge funds and leveraged investing.

## Audit

All BOC smart contracts were audited by independence lab, i.e. SlowMist, etc

## Bug Bounty program

In partnering with third parties we will establish a way for the community to help and improve on the general quality of used smart contracts.  Potential third party organizations including  premier bug bounty platform for smart contracts and DeFi projects, where security researchers review code, disclose vulnerabilities, get paid, and make crypto safer.
