The introduction of a tokenized long term no-risk rewarding system through the use of the open platform will allow for new incentives and transparent verifications. Enabled by the proven on-chain algo that allows chain interoperability and transactions, lenders will kick start their reward pattern with its first use case with the globally renowned AMM and Yield Aggrigator forecast to approach $US 200 billion in revenue by 2025. With the better security and optimization of decentralization, BOC can have a 300-500bp higher benchmark compared with US dollar wealth management, and a foundation to absorb hundreds of millions of dollars. BOC background: DeFi including yield farming, AMM, lending protocols The BOC Platform is a revolutionary algo that protects and transforms the investment on cryptocurrencies. The project will create a no-risk algo-structured automated world to avoid missing opportunities by connecting the audited algo to reliable protocol, and at the same time protect the fund lender from unnecessary risk. In order to avoid large fluctuations in the price of digital currency and cause free losses of market-making funds, this protocol is only for stablecoins assets, and is only limited to those with full collateral provided by fiat currency or by blue-chip digital assets. The mechanism within the platform’s operation allows for a wide coverage and usage rate across different public investing environments. Why is BOC Different Comparing Product BOC Yearn OUSD Aladdin DAO enzyme Harvest beefy alpha yield app Type DeFi Bank Yield Aggregator Stablecoin Yield Aggregator On-chain assest management Yield Aggregator Yield Aggregator Yield Aggregator DeFi Bank Details BOC is a DeFi protocol that provides the best long-term risk-free return Yearn Finance is a suite of products in Decentralized Finance (DeFi) that provides yield generation, lending aggregation, and more on the blockchain. The protocol is maintained by various independent developers and is governed by YFI holders. Origin Dollar (OUSD) is a new stablecoin that was initially launched on the Ethereum network. Its design is superior to existing stablecoins because OUSD captures competitive yields while being passively held in wallets. AladdinDAO is a decentralized network to shift crypto investments from venture capitalists to wisdom of crowds through collective value discovery. At AladdinDAO, a group of world class experts in DeFi known as the AladdinDAO Boule identifies the most promising DeFi projects and enables AladdinDAO community members to enjoy the returns of their liquidity mining programs. As a result, the protocol will help to reduce information asymmetry and optimize asset allocations for the DeFi space overall.

Harvest Finance is a yield farming protocol that lets users put their assets to work in high-producing farming opportunities. Beefy Finance is a Decentralized, Multi-Chain Yield Optimizer that allows its users to earn compound interest on their crypto holdings. Beefy earns you the highest APYs with safety and efficiency in mind. Alpha Finance Lab is an ecosystem of cross-chain DeFi products that focus on capturing unaddressed demand in an innovative and user friendly way. Alpha Homora, the first product, is a leveraged yield farming and leveraged liquidity providing protocol where ETH lenders can earn high lending interest rate and leveraged yield farmers/liquidity providers can increase the APY.

Until now, these parties have usually operated within their own independent environments when directly or indirectly servicing their own set of customers. The algo-based ecosystem and the defi network will be the key that unlocks the ‘gates’ between the fund lender and the reasonable profits. AMM and Yield Aggregator and operators are envisaged to grow their markets by attracting more funds from a wider demographic range. This will be done by allowing operators to engage with BOC fund lenders in algo development to help them assimilate to the content inside the protocol. For fund lenders, there will certainly be more safe investment choices. Parked funds will be more engaging by enhancing instance buy/sell, transparency, and tools to improve their chances of earning incomes. With a secured decentralized system, fund lender can also check their real time status within the BOC ecosystem and reach higher levels based on their level of participation and milestones reached. For new crypto-comers, it is a channel to enter into a rewarded ecosystem for their digital asset investment. They now have a one-click platform where their asset is protected by incentive features that can bring forth a new generation of income for more actions to enjoy. In summary, the investment model of the BOC Platform is the missing catalyst that will revolutionize the industry and generate a new market growth. var className='atoc'; © BOC Technical Team all right reserved，powered by Gitbookupdate time： 2022-03-25 16:07:35 "},"docs/CHAPTER2.html":{"url":"docs/CHAPTER2.html","title":"Protocol Design","keywords":"","body":"Protocol Design Yield farming strategy (Work in Progress / Pending for final design document) Determine whether the protocol meets the connect conditions Is there an deposit or withdrawal fee 是否有存取费用 Whether the used stablecoin has a corresponding chainlink exchange rate.

Since the actual exchange can be high or low, the same currency may not be exchanged, but the estimated loss is calculated based on the configured slippage value) 在deltaAsset>0时，表示策略投入 操作费用为：lendFee = 当前gasPrice *lendGas（lendGas为lend操作消耗的gas，通过预先测试预估得到的）兑换损失为：exchangeLoss = deltaAsset* exchangeLossRate（exchangeLossRate当前设置为配置好的滑点上限0.3%，由于实际兑换可高可低，同币种也可能不兑换，但是预估计算时，是以配置的滑点值来算损失） Funding remains unchanged 资金不变 When deltaAsset is 0, it indicated no action and thus no operation cost is required. 在deltaAsset为0时，表示不动，无操作费用 Harvest Funding Fees If the strategy retains funds after the position adjustment, it is necessary for the fund to perform Harvest selling and reinvesting during the cycle, and the required Harvest operation costs are: harvestFee = HarvestGas *durationDays (currently, harvest is performed every day in the assumed period) 当策略在调仓后还存留资金，则周期内还需要执行Harvest卖矿复投，需要Harvest操作费用为： harvestFee = HarvestGas* durationDays（当前是假设周期内每天执行harvest） The cost of changing the funds in the buffer pool is 缓冲池资金变更的成本为： For buffer pool funds, it is considered that:When fetching from the buffer pool:withdrawFee = 0When putting into the buffer pool:lendFee = 0exchangeLoss =0Buffer pool without HarvestharvestFee=0 Q&A 问题求解 When the requirement is the maximum sum of the deltaGain of all strategies: Total Change Gain = Sum(deltaGain -operateFee - exchangeLoss-harvestFee) =sum(deltaAsset*\\frac{(poolAsset-asset)}{(poolAsset+deltaAsset-exchangeLoss)}* apr * durationDays/yearDays - operateFee - exchangeLoss - harvestFee)In this formula, the only variable is the deltaAsset of each strategy 那么我们要求的就是，所有策略的deltaGain的总和最大值： 总变更收益 = Sum(deltaGain -operateFee - exchangeLoss-harvestFee) =sum(deltaAsset*\\frac{(poolAsset-asset)}{(poolAsset+deltaAsset-exchangeLoss)}* apr * durationDays/yearDays - operateFee - exchangeLoss - harvestFee)该公式中，唯一的变量为每个策略的deltaAsset Restrictions 约束条件：   The funds of the same protocol strategy (multiple constraints) do not exceed 30% of the total funds. For example, 1 and 2 strategies are the same as the protocol:  totalAsset * 0.3 - Asset1 - deltaAsset1 -Asset2-deltaAsset2 >=0  The sum of all asset changes in and out is 0: sum(deltaAsset) = 0 Boundary conditions 边界条件： Other asset constraints related to the size boundary calculation conditions of deltaAsset, are as follow: Strategic assets cannot exceed 20% of total assets The strategic funds cannot exceed 50% of the target pool assets The additional investment assets of the strategy cannot exceed the investable quota Therefore, the minimum value of deltaAsset is to exit all existing assets of the strategy, and the maximum value is the maximum investable asset after the above conditions limit. 其他资产限制条件，作为deltaAsset的大小边界计算条件，有 策略资产不能超过总资产20% 策略资金不能超过目标池子资产的50% 策略追加投入资产不能超过可投资配额 所以，deltaAsset最小为退出所有策略现有资产，最大值为上面的条件限制后的最大可投资资产 Solving Solution 求解： Currently, python scipy's optimize.minimize is used to find the minimum value (negative number) to find the optimal solution: Plain Text optimize.minimize( maxReturn, //The function to find the optimal solution, the maximum value formula obtained above res.x, //Input parameter, initial position [0,0,0,0,0] args=(aprs, originalAssets, poolAssets, lendGasFees, withdrawGasFees, harvestGasFees, exchangeLossRates), method='SLSQP', //minimize limit algorithm bounds=bnds, //The upper and lower boundaries of deltaAsset constraints=cons //Constraints )# Plain Text bnds=[[-2000,0],[-1000,1000]] cons.append({'type': 'eq', 'fun': lambda deltaAssets: np.sum(deltaAssets)}) # The sum of asset changes is 0 Example of the result obtained 得到的结果示例： {\"x\": [1000.1637007999999, 1998.3274016, 1998.3274016, 1998.3274016, -1.0, 999.1637007999998, 999.1637007999997, 999.1637008000002, -9991.637008], \"fun\": -3230.6623826483046, \"jac\": [-0.6831997276114634, -0.6836974718274632, -0.20573101933809995, -0.1967651001667491, -0.17336689662483878, -0.158915626574435, -0.12301853177496014, -0.09437430698781099, 0.0], \"nit\": 52, \"nfev\": 510, \"njev\": 51, \"status\": 0, \"message\": \"Optimization terminated successfully\", \"success\": true, \"originalApr\": [0.693805752190747, 0.693805752190747, 0.21582011365937293, 0.20715422941996242, 0.18236710019882918, 0.16893762018268976, 0.13315559493399354, 0.10437493594181224], \"newApr\": [0.6935041806541801, 0.6937514740983259, 0.21577545017119, 0.2069590855275276, 0.18236712564561333, 0.16892667777489306, 0.13308738685939211, 0.10437462303021353], \"originalGain\": [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], \"newGain\": [693.6177078433565, 1386.3425805910774, 431.18999466966443, 413.5720116197364, -0.1823671256456133, 168.78540452941124, 132.97608598423147, 104.28733461647309], \"operateLoss\": [10.001637008, 19.983274016, 19.983274016, 19.983274016, 0.0, 9.991637007999998, 9.991637007999996, 9.991637008000003], \"deltaGain\": [693.6177078433565, 1386.3425805910774, 431.18999466966443, 413.5720116197364, -0.1823671256456133, 168.78540452941124, 132.97608598423147, 104.28733461647309], \"deltaAssets\": [1000, 1998, 1998, 1998, -1, 999, 999, 999, -9992]} A better solution 更好的方案： Global Optimization Algorithm 全局优化算法Nonconvex Optimization Algorithms 非凸优化算法APY: Calculation of the initial APY of each strategy APY：各策略初始APY的计算Exchange: consider same token type input 兑换：考虑投入是否有相同币种 var className='atoc'; © BOC Technical Team all right reserved，powered by Gitbookupdate time： 2022-03-25 16:07:35 "},"docs/CHAPTER3.html":{"url":"docs/CHAPTER3.html","title":"Selection criteria for implemented Blockchains (Eth, polygon, BnB chain)","keywords":"","body":"Selection criteria for implemented Blockchains (Eth, polygon, BnB chain) The first batch of the protocol will be connected to billion worth smart contract platforms including Ethereum, Polygon, BNB etc. Due to the immature cross-chain technology, users can access the official cross-chain bridge maunally for asset conversion.

(WARN_UNRECOGNIZED_ELEMENT: PAGE_BREAK) Ethereum Ethereum is open access to digital money and data-friendly services for everyone – no matter your background or location. It's a community-built technology behind the cryptocurrency ether (ETH) and thousands of applications you can use today. An Open-source development is currently underway for a major upgrade to Ethereum known as Ethereum 2.0 or Eth2.[54] The main purpose of the upgrade is to increase transaction throughput for the network from the current of about 15 transactions per second to up to tens of thousands of transactions per second.

It is a network and framework for creating and linking Ethereum-compatible blockchains. Consensus on the Polygon network is reached through validators in a Proof of Stake (PoS) mechanism. The cost on Polygon is low, in just a fraction of a cent. Speed Transaction times on Polygon are also near instantaneous. The native token of Polygon is the Matic token, a legacy from the fact that Polygon was born out of the Matic project. As a layer 2 for Ethereum, Polygon supports the ERC20 and ERC721 token standards.

It will be the bridge between ecosystems for fund lenders and investment vehicle operators alike. As BOC becomes widely integrated and adopted, the next step for the BOC team will be to continue the expansion and adoption of new algo into the broader usage, and thereby creating a truly new and connected crypto investment world. DAO Development Currently, governance functions are approved via a multisig smart contract controlled by the BlockBank team. Users need to trust the BlockBank team not to abuse administrative functions. This trust requirement will exist until governance rights are transferred to a DAO which is planned for a later iteration based on the following direction: 1) Using Snapshot for off-chain voting, and contracts are executed on-chain. 2) The issuance contract of governance tokens is under development. The innovative protocol will be followed by a smart DAO organization combining lenders own digital asset marketplace to further maximize the influence thus reward from the market. Further down the road, BOC plans on expanding into other sectors, including hedge funds and leveraged investing.

Strategy Withdrawal amount will be send to Harvester for combined sales into USDT, and deposit into vault. Strategy value are estimated in the unit of USD. Actual Strategy APY are required to include gas fee value. USDi increase in vault is triggered by rebase. Profit sharing receiving time are revised to rebase(). Wallet and the Connection with BOC A wallet allows users to interact and perform investment transactions with BOC. The first step for user to connect a wallet is to enter the “CONNECT WALLET” button as seen on the front page of the BOC website. Users can connect a wallet using the Metamask Browser extension, or via WalletConnect. User can also acquire corresponding USD-pegged crypto assets in the following ways: Minting USD-pegged crypto assets by depositing USD into the underlying Blockchain and receiving USD-pegged crypto assets in return. For instance the example of FUSD on Fantom. Using BlockBank Application to exchange supported USD stable coin assets, stable coin exchange uses 1Inch and Paraswap aggregators to reduce slippage. Purchasing stable coins on the decentralized exchanges directly: Paraswap & 1inch Once the wallet are connected, the crypto asset values should automatically displayed as a connected wallet where LP can now begin to start the parameters setup as well as the yield farming process. Parameters Setup (Blockchain Networks and Blockchain Bridges) With a valid Wallet connection, the following parameters can be set: Blockchain Bridge Selection When users need to move crypto tokens from one blockchain to another, the blockchain bridge is the method to allow the transfer of assets. In BOC, you can select the related bridge type for your action. Blockchain Main Chain Selection Users can select which main chain is the operation to focus on by selecting the chain from the related drop-down list. Deposit and Withdrawal Overview Deposit Asset - once the user has successfully connected the wallet with BOC, he/she may start the investment process by selecting the deposit amount into the intended vault. Choose the amount to deposit or select “Max” for full deposit. Withdrawal Withdraw Asset - once the user has successfully invested with the wallet by deposit on BOC, he/she may start the withdrawal process at any time by selecting the withdrawal amount from the intended vault. Choose the amount to withdrawal or select “Max” for full withdrawal from the selected vault. How to understand your investment earning About the actual APY calculator, please refer to the APY section for the details. Users can see their immediate withdrawal amount or the estimated amount on the withdrawal screen.

Users have to understand the risks of projects and smart contracts before venturing into DeFi. This section focuses on the risk associated with BOC and the interaction with the users, aiming to have transparency with higher risk standards created in the future development within BOC and the DeFi. The following is a non-exhaustive list of security properties that were implemented. In order to avoid losses caused by code vulnerabilities, all protocols shall be audited by reputable auditors. In order to reduce the oracle attack vector, the quotation of the stable coin must be based on the Chain Link rather than the protocol itself. In order to avoid the chained system risks caused by nested tokens and Lego blocks, access to the BlockBank Ecosystem requires long-term safe operation records and community voting permission. In order to avoid losses caused by market fluctuations, the agreement to obtain financial returns by providing risk services is temporarily not connected. The yield using BOC algo can be at risk including but not limited to certain conditions that are applied. Yield Dilution Risk The increased liquidity from big whales can further dilute the yield of investing funds in a particular pool (being “backran”) during rebalancing intervals. Smart Contract Risk Smart contracts due to the complexities, even audited by the professional, can still post risk and are prone to hacks and unforeseeable events. Market Risk The counterparty on the borrowers’ side lending protocols are also in default risk that cannot be rectified by liquidation in an extreme case of market fluctuation. Transaction Cost Risk The automatic rebalancing that was triggered by network congestion will result in high transaction fee (gas fee) and affects the final yield rate. var className='atoc'; © BOC Technical Team all right reserved，powered by Gitbookupdate time： 2022-03-25 16:07:35 "},"docs/CHAPTER8.html":{"url":"docs/CHAPTER8.html","title":"FAQ","keywords":"","body":"FAQ How is BOC different?

The system removes the control banks and institutions have on money, financial products, and financial services. AMM Automated market makers (AMM) is an autonomous trading mechanism that eliminates the need for centralized exchanges and related market-making techniques. It incentivizes users to become liquidity providers in exchange for a share of transaction fees and free tokens. Lending Protocol Lending Protocol allows the lenders to deposit their cryptocurrencies in a pool and allows the holders to stake the coins they have in the DeFi lending platforms for lending purposes. A coin holder sends the tokens they intend to lend into a pool using a smart contract. Once the coins are sent to a smart contract, they become available to other users to borrow. Yield Aggregators “yield aggregators” are sets of contracts that pool these staked funds together and allow users to optimize their yield farming by allowing “vaults” to automatically harvest their farming rewards and reinvest them in the liquidity pools. Vaults Vaults are the massively adopted term to represent the smart-contract strategies developed by yield optimizers. Keeper Keeper is a cryptocurrencies product to store bitcoin private key in a secure way. Harvest Finance Harvest Finance a Yield Aggregator that aggregates and automates the process of yield farming for our users. APY (Annual percentage yield) Annual percentage yield is the rate of return gained over the course of a year on a specific investment. var className='atoc'; © BOC Technical Team all right reserved，powered by Gitbookupdate time： 2022-03-25 16:07:35 "},"docs/CHAPTER10.html":{"url":"docs/CHAPTER10.html","title":"Reference Material","keywords":"","body":"Reference Material 策略对接流程 链外APY计算 调仓计算处理 BoC 产品讨论202202（更新 V1.2）(2) 区块链银行项目简介 — 区块链银行是帮助普通投资者获取链上“无风险”保本理财的一款去中心化金融协议。针对普通投资者，该协议进行以下优化，以降低使用风险，提升用户体验： 1， 客户的保本收益来自于1）为DEX提供做市资金收取的交易手续费2）为超额抵押借贷提供借贷资金收取的利息3）在以上过程中获得的协议管理代币补贴 2，为避免数字货币价格大幅度波动产生的心理恐惧，并引发做市资金的无偿损失，该协议只针对稳定币资产，且仅限于有由法币提供足额抵押或由蓝筹数字资产提供超额抵押生成的稳定币。 3，为避免代码漏洞造成的损失，所有的协议均经过审计。 4， 为减少预言机攻击向量， 稳定币的报价必须基于Chain Link而不是协议本身。 5，为避免嵌套代币、乐高组合产生的连锁性系统风险，接入的聚合理财协议，需要有长期的安全运营记录，并得到社区投票许可。 6， 为避免市场波动导致损失，暂不接入通过提供风险服务获取资金回报的协议。 7， 为避免市场波动导致损失，暂不通过杠杆放大资金回报。 8， 该协议第一批将接入锁仓超过50亿美元的以太坊、Polygon、BNB等3个智能合约平台。鉴于跨链技术尚不成熟，现阶段由用户手动使用官方跨链桥进行资产转换。 9，首批接入的DEX和借贷协议均为各区块链上的首选一线协议，并有良好的安全运营记录。 10， 协议提供资金链内择优分配服务，该分配兼具回报最大化及资金风险分散两项原则。1）优先分配给高收益的资金池2）单个资金池的投入资金，不能超过总投资资产的20%3）单个资金池的投入资金，不能超过其现有锁仓量的50%4）同协议多个资金池的投入资金，不能超过总投资资产的30%5）定期进行收益评估，在调仓收益大于调仓成本时，对资金进行优化配置 11，稳定币兑换采用1Inch和paraswap聚合器，减少滑点。 12， 协议的DAO治理1）Snapshot链下投票，合约链上执行2）治理代币的发行合约也在开发中 var className='atoc'; © BOC Technical Team all right reserved，powered by Gitbookupdate time： 2022-03-25 16:07:35 "}}
