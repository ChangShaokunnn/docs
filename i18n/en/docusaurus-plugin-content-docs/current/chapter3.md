# Protocol Components

## Incorporated Blockchains

BOC chosen blockchains are compatible with EVM, and BOC has already connected with Ethereum, BNB Chain and Polygon chain.

### Ethereum

Ethereum is a decentralized open source public blockchain platform with smart contract functions,  whose native cryptocurrency is ETH.. In December 2021, Ethereum became  the second most valuable cryptocurrency by market capitalization after Bitcoin, and  the most widely used blockchain.

The concept of Ethereum was first proposed between 2013 and 2014 by the programmer Vitalik Buterin after being inspired by Bitcoin as "the next generation of cryptocurrency and decentralized application platform".  Ethereum development started through ICO crowdfunding in 2014.

Ethereum is also known as the "second-generation blockchain platform", second only to Bitcoin.

### BNB

Binance Smart Chain (formerly called BSC) is a blockchain compatible with the Ethereum virtual machine in parallel to the Binance Chain. It is a cutting-edge project in the crypto asset industry. By introducing the Proof of Stake Authority (PoSA) consensus mechanism, BNB creates a validating ecosystem that allows nodes, token holders, developers and users to enjoy the full  benefit of  the blockchain, such as higher performance and abundance of innovation space.

On February 15, 2022, the cryptocurrency exchange Binance announced that the original Binance Smart Chain (BSC) will be renamed to BNB Chain. BNB is the Binance Exchange platform cryptocurrency  that powers the BNB Chain Ecosystem, and is one of the world’s most popular utility tokens.

### Polygon

Polygon is a protocol for building and interconnecting Ethereum-compatible blockchain networks. The project was launched in India in 2017 under the original name Matic Network. In February 2021, the project name was changed to Polygon. The cryptocurrency of the Polygon project is MATIC, one of the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market cap traded on major exchanges.

## Incorporated Stablecoins

In order to avoid the psychological fear caused by the fluctuations of digital currency value and the losses of market-making funds, the BOC protocol has selected only stable currency assets, and is only limited to those with full collateral provided by legal currency or by blue chip digital assets. stablecoins. Stablecoins need to meet the following conditions:

- pass audit
- Insurance available
- stablecoin quotes must be based on ChainLink rather than the protocol itself to reduce oracle attack.
- Scale greater than $1 billion

The currently selected strategic stablecoins are: DAI, USDC, USDT, BUSD, USDP, TUSD, LUSD.

### DAI

Dai is a stablecoin cryptocurrency designed to keep its value as close to a dollar as possible through an automated system of smart contracts on the ethereum blockchain.

## Incorporated Protocol

The strategies need to meet the following conditions after the stablecoins are selected:

- No withdrawal fee
- No admission fee
- No lock-up period (some strategies have a lock-up period, and funds cannot be retrieved for a certain period of time)
- No investment limit (some strategies have a limit on funds)
- To avoid losses caused by code vulnerabilities, all protocols are audited.
- In order to avoid the chain system risk caused by nested tokens and LEGO combinations, the access to the aggregated financial management protocol needs to have a long-term security operation record and obtain the voting permission of the community.
- In order to avoid losses caused by market fluctuations, the protocol for obtaining capital returns by providing risky services will not be accessed for the time being.
- In order to avoid losses caused by market fluctuations, leverage is not being used to magnify capital returns for the time being.
- The first batch of the agreement will be connected to three smart contract platforms including Ethereum, Polygon, and BNB that have a locked up size more than $5 billion. In view of the immature cross-chain technology, at this stage, users shall manually use the official cross-chain bridge for asset conversion.
- The first DEX and lending protocols to be accessed are the first-line protocols of choice on various blockchains, and have a good record of security operations.
- The protocol provides the optimal allocation service within the capital chain, which combines the two principles of maximizing returns and diversifying capital risks.

The currently selected protocols include:

- For Ethereum, there are Convex, DODO, SushiSwap, Balancer, etc.
- For BNB Chain, there are DForce, Synapse, Venus, DODO, Belt, Pancakeswap, Alpaca, etc.
- For Polygon, there are DODO, Synapse, Quickswap, Balancer, Aave, Curve, SushiSwap, etc.

### Aave

Aave is an open source decentralized lending protocol that provides users with deposit and lending services. The deposit and loan interest rates of users on both sides of the borrower and lenders are calculated by algorithms based on the platform's borrowing volume and deposit volume, and the platform uses Chainlink's oracle to ensure the fairness of the collateral price. According to the data of DeFi Pulse, as of March 30, 2022, Aave's total fund lock-up volume was approximately US$11.79 billion, ranking second in DeFi application lock-up volume.

### Curve

Curve is a decentralized exchange deployed on Ethereum. Curve is designed for trading between stablecoins with low fees and slippage through an automated market maker protocol. It is a decentralized liquidity aggregator, and anyone can add their own assets to the liquidity pool to earn market-making benefits. According to the data of DeFi Pulse, as of March 30, 2022, Curve's total fund lock-up volume was approximately US$10.79 billion, ranking third in DeFi application lock-up volume.

### Convex

Convex is a one-stop platform for CRV staking and liquidity mining on Ethereum that is dedicated to simplifying the use of Curve.

As a revenue aggregator on the Ethereum chain, Convex aims to use the CVX token to simplify the process of locking and staking Curve and CRV through a simple and easy-to-use interface, and to improve the compensation of CRV token holders and liquidity providers. This facilitates the development of the CRV ecosystem. According to the data of DeFi Pulse, as of March 30, 2022, Convex's total locked funds amounted to about $10.1 billion, ranking fourth in DeFi applications.

### Uniswap

Uniswap is a decentralized exchange deployed on Ethereum. The Uniswap protocol facilitates automated transactions between cryptocurrency tokens on the Ethereum blockchain through the use of smart contracts. As of October 2020, Uniswap is estimated to be the largest decentralized exchange and the fourth largest cryptocurrency exchange by daily trading volume. According to the data of DeFi Pulse, as of March 30, 2022, Uniswap's total locked funds amounted to about $7.04 billion, ranking sixth in DeFi applications.

### Balancer

Balancer is a decentralized exchange deployed on Ethereum. Balancer uses automatic market makers to achieve the function of decentralized transactions. Transaction users can choose trading pairs to trade and pay transaction fees, while liquidity providers can get a share of the fees. According to the data of DeFi Pulse, as of March 30, 2022, Balancer's total fund lock-up volume was about 2.19 billion US dollars, ranking 6th in DeFi application lock-up volume.

### SushiSwap

SushiSwap was originally a fork of Uniswap, built upon Uniswap's code, while introducing some key differences. One of the biggest differences is that rewards are issued in SUSHI tokens. SushiSwap's liquidity providers are rewarded with the protocol's native token, SUSHI, which is also a governance token. Unlike Uniswap (UNI), SUSHI holders can continue to earn yields even after they cease to provide liquidity. According to DeFi Pulse, as of March 30, 2022, among the rankings of centralized exchanges, Sushiswap's total lock-up volume of funds was approximately US$1.68 billion, ranking 11th in DeFi application lock-up volume.

### Quickswap

Quickswap is a layer2 decentralized exchange, similar to Uniswap and Sushiswap, using the AMM method. Anyone can invest money on Quickswap, provide liquidity, and earn income by staking liquidity tokens again. Quickswap's token, QUICK, is used as a governance token, and holders can submit proposals for changes to the protocol. According to the data of DeFi Pulse, as of March 30, 2022, among the rankings of centralized exchanges, Quickswap's total locked funds amounted to about US$473 million, ranking 22nd among DeFi applications.

### DODO

DODO is a decentralized trading platform that uses an original Active Market Maker (PMM) algorithm to provide efficient on-chain liquidity for Web3 assets, allowing everyone to easily issue and trade Web3 assets. DODO not only provides liquidity by itself, but also aggregates the liquidity of other exchanges. This allows DODO to offer the best prices on the entire network. According to the data of DeFi Pulse, as of March 30, 2022, DODO's total fund lock-up volume was approximately US$47,700 million, ranking 52nd in DeFi application lock-up volume.

### dForce

dForce is committed to building an integrated and interoperable matrix of open financial protocols and currency protocols, including lending protocols (global liquidity pools, interest-earning markets), asset-based protocols (multi-currency stablecoins, synthetic assets, etc.) liquidity protocols (transactions) Aggregators, automatic market makers) three categories. As of March 30, 2022, dForce's total lock-up volume of funds was approximately US$15,400, and DeFi applications ranked 69th in lock-up volume.

### Synapse

Synapse was upgraded and renamed from Nerve Finance, an anonymous cross-chain liquidity protocol on the original BNB Chain.

Synapse adopts cross-chain multi-party computation (MPC) validator and threshold signature scheme to support assets, smart contract calls, etc. Synapse connects different blockchains for easy and secure interoperability; developers can also build real cross-chain applications, including cross-chain DEXs, lending platforms, margin systems, derivatives markets, income aggregators, and more.

### Venus

Venus is a synthetic stablecoin-driven decentralized currency market system on the BNB Chain, providing users with cryptocurrency lending solutions without the need for any third-party custody of funds or centralized entities to exercise more control over the protocol .

Borrowers on Venus can get instant loans in stablecoins after holding cryptocurrency. This enables users to obtain additional funds without having to sell their non-stablecoin digital assets. On the other hand, lenders can deposit stablecoins (and other different cryptocurrencies) on the platform to earn passive income. What makes Venus unique is how it promotes its own synthetic stablecoin within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. The synthetic stablecoins can maintain stable long-term value without holding the real-world assets they are pegged to (such as through algorithms, ecosystem incentive schemes, or using other forms of collateral).

### Pancakeswap

Pancakeswap is a decentralized exchange on BNB Chain. Users can earn market-making income by providing liquidity to the platform, and earn Cake tokens by staking.

### Alpaca

Alpaca is the largest lending protocol on the BNB Chain that provides leveraged farms. Alpaca helps lenders earn income and provides borrowers with leveraged farm position loans with insufficient collateral, which maximizes the principal benefit of farmers' mining and can generate multiple returns.

## Incorporated Oracle

Oracles are data sources that connect Ethereum to off-chain, real-world information so that user can query data in smart contracts. It allows certain smart contracts to respond to the uncertain external world, and is the only way for smart contracts to interact with the outside world, and it is also the interface between blockchain and the real world.

Chainlink

Chainlink is a decentralized oracle network that bridges the gap between smart contracts (like those on Ethereum) and their external data. The blockchain itself cannot connect to external applications in a trusted manner. Chainlink is not a single network of oracles, but an ecosystem of many decentralized oracle networks running in parallel, whose token is LINK.
