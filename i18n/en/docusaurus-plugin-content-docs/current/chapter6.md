# Governance

BOC is a disruptive blockchain innovation that aims to change the ecosystem around the crypto investment industry. It will serve as a bridge between fund lenders and investment operators. BOC will be applied to a wider range of fields, thereby creating a truly new, connected world of crypto investing.

## DAO Development

At present, the governance of BOC is to achieve co-management through Gnosis multi-signature. In the future, governance rights will be transferred to DAO. The DAO program will continue to iterate in the following directions:

* Using snapshots for off-chain voting, proposals will be executed by on-chain smart contracts.
* Governance tokens are under development.

## Tokenomics

The maximum supply of BOC tokens is 1 billion. TokenHolder will receive a BOC management fee according to the holding ratio. After the tokens are locked, they can participate in governance and share the benefits. The specific tokens are planned to be distributed in the following 4 parts: team, investors, community and reserved part.

## Audit

All BOC smart contracts are audited by independent labs (e.g. SlowMist, etc.)

## Bug Bounty Program

By collaborating with third parties, BOC will establish a way in the community to help and improve the quality of smart contracts used. Potential third-party organizations include the premier bug bounty platform and the DeFi Project. In those organizations, security researchers review code, disclose vulnerabilities, get paid, and make BOC's smart contracts more secure.
