## Glossary

Decentralized Finance (Defi)  
Decentralized finance (commonly known as DeFi) is a kind of finance created on the blockchain. It does not rely on financial institutions such as brokerages, exchanges or banks to provide financial tools, but uses smart contracts on the blockchain ( such as Ethereum) for financial activities. DeFi platforms allow people to lend or borrow funds to others, trade cryptocurrencies, and earn interest in savings-like accounts.

Automated Market Maker (AMM)  
An Automated Market Maker (AMM) is an autonomous trading mechanism that eliminates the need for centralized trading and related market making techniques. It encourages users to become liquidity providers in exchange for a portion of transaction fees and free tokens.

Lending Protocol  
Lending Protocol is a platform composed of lenders and borrowers. On the one hand, it allows lenders to borrow cryptocurrencies from the platform and pay interest, and on the other hand, it allows depositors to deposit cryptocurrencies to the platform to earn interest. Defi lending protocols can often offer much higher interest rates compared to bank deposit accounts.

Yield Aggregators  
Yield Aggregators is an aggregation platform that supports multiple DeFi protocols. It can automatically move positions between various DeFi protocols that provide liquidity mining, helping users to obtain higher returns.

Vaults  
Vaults is a complex investment strategy that combines lending, staking, trading, etc. to maximize profits.

Keeper  
The centralized timer developed by the BOC project is used for timing triggering of on-chain tasks (harvesting, rebalancing, reinvestment of incremental funds, etc.).

Annual Yield (APY)  
Annual percentage yield is a way of measuring how much money an investment account makes in a year, a way of measuring the rise in interest over time. The basic calculation formula is

Parameter “periods” is the interest payment periods.

Protocol  
Protocol is a set of codes or requirements that regulate how a blockchain works. It sets out a broad set of rules, such as the interface of the blockchain, the interaction of participating computers, the types of data that should be shared, Incentives for developers participating in the network and more.

Strategy  
Strategy refers to smart contracts that interface with third-party agreements. BOC Vault has multiple policies, and the policy is one-to-one with external third-party agreements.
