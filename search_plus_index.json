Until now, these parties have usually operated within their own independent environments when directly or indirectly servicing their own set of customers. The algo-based ecosystem and the defi network will be the key that unlocks the ‘gates’ between the fund lender and the reasonable profits. AMM and Yield Aggregator and operators are envisaged to grow their markets by attracting more funds from a wider demographic range. This will be done by allowing operators to engage with BOC fund lenders in algo development to help them assimilate to the content inside the protocol. For fund lenders, there will certainly be more safe investment choices. Parked funds will be more engaging by enhancing instance buy/sell, transparency, and tools to improve their chances of earning incomes. With a secured decentralized system, fund lenders can also check their real time status within the BOC ecosystem and reach higher levels based on their level of participation and milestones reached. For new crypto-comers, it is a channel to enter into a rewarded ecosystem for their digital asset investment. They now have a one-click platform where their asset is protected by incentive features that can bring forth a new generation of income for more actions to enjoy. WHAT IS BOC BOC proposes to create a leading no-risk automated protocol to reward users and stakeholders in the global crypto investment world. The introduction of a tokenized long term no-risk rewarding system through the use of the open platform will allow for new incentives and transparent verifications. Enabled by the proven on-chain algo that allows chain interoperability and transactions, lenders will kick start their reward pattern with its first use case with the globally renowned AMM and Yield Aggrigator forecast to approach $US 200 billion in revenue by 2025. With the better security and optimization of decentralization, BOC can have a 300-500bp higher benchmark compared with US dollar wealth management, and a foundation to absorb hundreds of millions of dollars. BOC Source of Yield BOC is a Defi protocol that provides the best long-term high ‘low-risk return and it’s source of Yield includes: Market-making fee Interest from over-collateralized lending Government token rewards Why is BOC Different BOC is easy to use User shall deposit and withdraw directly without the complexity to implement and bear cost of complex operations such as farming, exchange, and reallocation. Profits are automatically reinvested with an immediate deposit and withdrawal process. Historical and dynamic returns are intuitively visible. The investment on BOC is safe: The market cap of qualified stablecoins exceeds 1 billion dollar. The TVL of qualified Blockchains exceeds 5 billion dollar BOS has third party auditing in place. BOC does not use unofficial third party cross-chain bridges for transactions. BOC price quotation relies on Chainlink, a market leading oracle. BOC has a reliable risk control procedure: Minimizing de-anchoring risk of stablecoins: No algorithmic stablecoin, No partially collateralized stablecoin, No stablecoin collateralized by long-tail asset. Minimizing the risk of impermanent loss: market-making for stablecoin pairs only. Minimizing the systemic risk: Very selective wrapped tokens and yield aggregators. Minimizing the long-tail risk: no yield are generated from risk servicing business, such as insurance underwriting, sell call options No risk in leveraging: no leverage function is provided. BOC is a smart-based product: BOC regularly calibrates the yield, weighing the cost and reward for funds reallocation. BOC searches for the best rate through exchange aggregators. BOC performs FX interest swap, adjusting FX synthesis based on exchange rate and yield. BOC automatically sets parameters for market-making and lending strategy. In summary, the investment model of the BOC Platform is the missing catalyst that will revolutionize the industry and generate new market growth.

A smart contract on the blockchain can then use the data, typically to make a decision about whether to dispense money and to whom. The Oracle currently go live include: Chainlink Chainlink is essentially a decentralized ecosystem that provides data from the real world to the siloed world of blockchains. Chainlink’s token is called LINK and is used to compensate oracles for their work in finding accurate data at the request of smart contracts in Chainlink’s ecosystem. https://chain.link/ Incorporated Stablecoins The first collection of live assets were stable coins pegged to the US dollar. Since BlockBank supports multi-chain asset management, each chain is backed by a basket of selected USD stable coins. Each asset in the vault has a set of maximum and minimum weights. The assets currently go live include: DAI Dai is created from an overcollateralized loan and repayment process facilitated by MakerDAO's smart contracts in the form of a decentralized application. https://makerdao.com/en/ USDC USD Coin (USDC) is a digital stablecoin that is pegged to the United States dollar. USD Coin is managed by a consortium called Centre. https://www.centre.io/usdc USDT Tether (USDT) is a cryptocurrency that is hosted on the Ethereum and Bitcoin blockchains.

Protocol Selection Criteria The strategies need to meet the following conditions after the stablecoins are selected: No withdrawal fee No admission fee No lock-up period (some strategies have a lock-up period, and funds cannot be retrieved for a certain period of time) No investment limit (some strategies have a limit on funds) To avoid losses caused by code vulnerabilities, all protocols are audited. In order to avoid the chain system risk caused by nested tokens and LEGO combinations, the access to the aggregated financial management protocol needs to have a long-term security operation record and obtain the voting permission of the community. In order to avoid losses caused by market fluctuations, the protocol for obtaining capital returns by providing risky services will not be accessed for the time being. In order to avoid losses caused by market fluctuations, leverage is not being used to magnify capital returns for the time being. The first batch of the agreement will be connected to three smart contract platforms including Ethereum, Polygon, and BNB that have a locked up size more than $5 billion. In view of the immature cross-chain technology, at this stage, users shall manually use the official cross-chain bridge for asset conversion. The first DEX and lending protocols to be accessed are the first-line protocols of choice on various blockchains, and have a good record of security operations. The protocol provides the optimal allocation service within the capital chain, which combines the two principles of maximizing returns and diversifying capital risks. Protocol Description Ethereum Ethereum is open access to digital money and data-friendly services for everyone – no matter user's background or location. It's a community-built technology behind the cryptocurrency ether (ETH) and thousands of applications user can use today. Polygon Polygon is a developer-first hybrid POS+Plasma side-chain on top of Ethereum, enabling Ethereum developers to scale their dApps for large-scale usage. It is a network and framework for creating and linking Ethereum-compatible blockchains. BNB Binance BNB operates similarly to the Ethereum ecosystem as is EVM-compatible, therefore the Ethereum smart contracts are fully compatible, with additional tweaks to make the blockchain faster.

Version 1.5 main process flow diagram: Note: Deposit - The BOC protocol supports users to deposit the three major stablecoins (USDT, USDC, DAI) in any combination and in any amount, and mint USDi of corresponding value to return to the user. Withdrawal - Users can exchange USDi back to the three major stablecoins at any time through the BOC protocol. By default, they will be returned according to the proportion of the three major stablecoins in the Vault at that time, or they can specify a certain currency to be returned. After Vault receives the stablecoin, it queries the price of the user's transfer of the stablecoin through an external oracle. l (When the price returned by the oracle machine is higher than 1USD, it is calculated as 1USD, and when it is lower than 1USD, it is calculated as the price of the oracle machine) According to the calculated value, USDi of the same value is minted and given to the user. The keeper module reaches the Dohardwork trigger condition and triggers Dohardwork. Vault calls the aggregate redemption module. The aggregated exchange module completes the exchange. The aggregate exchange module transfers the target currency to the Vault. Vault puts stablecoins into the strategy according to the currency required by the strategy. Strategies to invest stablecoins into third-party protocols. The keeper module reaches the farming trigger condition and triggers the farming. Harvester triggers each strategy to execute farming. Each strategy implements mining. Strategies move coins to farminger. Harvester sells mining coins into stablecoins through aggregate exchange. Harvester moves stablecoins into Vault. The Keeper module reaches the Rebase trigger condition and triggers the Rebase. Vault issues additional USDi. Vault collects a portion of the proceeds, which is transferred to the Treasury. The treasury will benefit users to buy back BOC governance tokens. Harvest The HarvestTrigger is triggered every day to determine whether the Harvest condition is met.

It will be the bridge between ecosystems for fund lenders and investment vehicle operators alike. As BOC becomes widely integrated and adopted, the next step for the BOC team will be to continue the expansion and adoption of new algo into the broader usage, and thereby creating a truly new and connected crypto investment world. DAO Development Currently, governance functions are approved via a multisig smart contract controlled by the BlockBank team. Users need to trust the BlockBank team not to abuse administrative functions. This trust requirement will exist until governance rights are transferred to a DAO which is planned for a later iteration based on the following direction: 1) Using Snapshot for off-chain voting, and contracts are executed on-chain. 2) The issuance contract of governance tokens is under development. The innovative protocol will be followed by a smart DAO organization combining lenders own digital asset marketplace to further maximize the influence thus reward from the market. Further down the road, BOC plans on expanding into other sectors, including hedge funds and leveraged investing. Audit All BOC smart contracts were audited by independence lab, i.e. SlowMist, etc Bug Bounty program In partnering with third parties we will establish a way for the community to help and improve on the general quality of used smart contracts. Potential third party organizations including premier bug bounty platform for smart contracts and DeFi projects, where security researchers review code, disclose vulnerabilities, get paid, and make crypto safer.

This section focuses on the risk associated with BOC and the interaction with the users, aiming to have transparency with higher risk standards created in the future development within BOC and the DeFi. The following is a non-exhaustive list of security properties that were implemented. In order to avoid losses caused by code vulnerabilities, all protocols shall be audited by reputable auditors. In order to reduce the oracle attack vector, the quotation of the stable coin must be based on the Chain Link rather than the protocol itself. In order to avoid the chained system risks caused by nested tokens and Lego blocks, access to the BlockBank Ecosystem requires long-term safe operation records and community voting permission. In order to avoid losses caused by market fluctuations, the agreement to obtain financial returns by providing risk services is temporarily not connected. The yield using BOC algo can be at risk including but not limited to certain conditions that are applied. Yield Dilution Risk The increased liquidity from big whales can further dilute the yield of investing funds in a particular pool (being “backran”) during rebalancing intervals. Smart Contract Risk Smart contracts due to the complexities, even audited by the professional, can still post risk and are prone to hacks and unforeseeable events. Market Risk The counterparty on the borrowers’ side lending protocols are also in default risk that cannot be rectified by liquidation in an extreme case of market fluctuation. Transaction Cost Risk The automatic rebalancing that was triggered by network congestion will result in high transaction fee (gas fee) and affects the final yield rate. Oracle Attack Risk Adversaries can manipulate lending platform that use a DEX as their sole price oracle and temporarily distorts the price of tokens, jeopardizing the safety of lenders’ funds on the lending platform. var className='atoc'; © BOC Technical Team all right reserved，powered by Gitbookupdate time： 2022-03-26 08:05:27 "},"docs/CHAPTER8.html":{"url":"docs/CHAPTER8.html","title":"FAQ","keywords":"","body":"FAQ How is BOC different?

The first step for user to connect a wallet is to enter the “CONNECT WALLET” button as seen on the front page of the BOC website. Users can connect a wallet using the Metamask Browser extension, or via WalletConnect. User can also acquire corresponding USD-pegged crypto assets in the following ways: Minting USD-pegged crypto assets by depositing USD into the underlying Blockchain and receiving USD-pegged crypto assets in return. For instance the example of FUSD on Fantom. Using BlockBank Application to exchange supported USD stable coin assets, stable coin exchange uses 1Inch and Paraswap aggregators to reduce slippage. Purchasing stable coins on the decentralized exchanges directly: Paraswap & 1inch Once the wallet are connected, the crypto asset values should automatically displayed as a connected wallet where LP can now begin to start the parameters setup as well as the yield farming process. Parameters Setup (Blockchain Networks and Blockchain Bridges) With a valid Wallet connection, the following parameters can be set: Blockchain Bridge Selection When users need to move crypto tokens from one blockchain to another, the blockchain bridge is the method to allow the transfer of assets. In BOC, user can select the related bridge type for user's action. Blockchain Main Chain Selection Users can select which main chain is the operation to focus on by selecting the chain from the related drop-down list.

The system removes the control banks and institutions have on money, financial products, and financial services. AMM Automated market makers (AMM) is an autonomous trading mechanism that eliminates the need for centralized exchanges and related market-making techniques. It incentivizes users to become liquidity providers in exchange for a share of transaction fees and free tokens. Lending Protocol Lending Protocol allows the lenders to deposit their cryptocurrencies in a pool and allows the holders to stake the coins they have in the DeFi lending platforms for lending purposes. A coin holder sends the tokens they intend to lend into a pool using a smart contract. Once the coins are sent to a smart contract, they become available to other users to borrow. Yield Aggregators “yield aggregators” are sets of contracts that pool these staked funds together and allow users to optimize their yield farming by allowing “vaults” to automatically farming their farming rewards and reinvest them in the liquidity pools. Vaults Vaults are the massively adopted term to represent the smart-contract strategies developed by yield optimizers. Keeper Keeper is a cryptocurrencies product to store bitcoin private key in a secure way. farming Finance farming Finance a Yield Aggregator that aggregates and automates the process of yield farming for our users. APY (Annual percentage yield) Annual percentage yield is the rate of return gained over the course of a year on a specific investment. Proof of Stake (PoS) Proof-of-stake is a cryptocurrency consensus mechanism for processing transactions and creating new blocks in a blockchain. Plasma Plasma or so-called Plasma Bridge is a set of contracts developed by Polygon that help in moving assets from the root chain to the child chain and provides increased security guarantees due to the Plasma exit mechanism. Staking A process that involves committing user's crypto assets to support a blockchain network and confirm transactions. Protocol Protocol is an establishment of the blockchain structure that allows digital money to be securely exchanged on the internet. Vault A vault can receive cryptocurrency like a normal wallet, but can also prevent stored crypto from being immediately withdrawn by adding optional security. Strategy Trading strategy involves taking positions and exiting. The aim of a trader while adopting such a trade is to book profits amid intraday price movements in a cryptocurrency of his choice. Slippage Slippage is the difference between the expected price of an order and the price when the order actually executes.
