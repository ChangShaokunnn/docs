## 未来发展

The BOC platform is a disruptive innovation that aims to change the ecosystem revolving around crypto investment industries. It will be the bridge between ecosystems for fund lenders and investment vehicle operators alike. As BOC becomes widely integrated and adopted, the next step for the BOC team will be to continue the expansion and adoption of new algo into the broader usage, and thereby creating a truly new and connected crypto investment world.

BOC是一项颠覆性创新，旨在改变围绕加密投资行业的生态系统。它将成为基金贷款人和投资工具运营商之间的桥梁。随着中国银行被广泛整合和采用，中国银行团队的下一步将是继续扩展和采用新的algo，并将其应用到更广泛的应用中，从而创造一个真正新的、互联的加密投资世界。

## DAO 规划

Currently, governance functions are approved via a multisig smart contract controlled by the BlockBank team. Users need to trust the BlockBank team not to abuse administrative functions. This trust requirement will exist until governance rights are transferred to a DAO which is planned for a later iteration based on the following direction:

1) Using Snapshot for off-chain voting, and contracts are executed on-chain.

2) The issuance contract of governance tokens is under development.

The innovative protocol will be followed by a smart DAO organization combining lenders own digital asset marketplace to further maximize the influence thus reward from the market. Further down the road, BOC plans on expanding into other sectors, including hedge funds and leveraged investing.

目前，治理职能通过区块银行团队控制的multisig智能合同获得批准。用户需要信任区块银行团队，不要滥用管理功能。这种信任要求将一直存在，直到治理权转移到DAO，该DAO计划根据以下方向进行后续迭代：

1） 使用快照进行链外投票，合同在链上执行。

2） 治理代币的发行合同正在开发中。

创新协议之后，智能DAO组织将结合贷款人自己的数字资产市场，进一步最大化市场的影响力，从而获得市场回报。接下来，中国银行计划向其他行业扩张，包括对冲基金和杠杆投资。

## 审计

All BOC smart contracts were audited by independence lab, i.e. SlowMist, etc

所有中行智能合约均由独立实验室（即SlowMist等）审计

## Bug 赏金计划

In partnering with third parties we will establish a way for the community to help and improve on the general quality of used smart contracts.  Potential third party organizations including  premier bug bounty platform for smart contracts and DeFi projects, where security researchers review code, disclose vulnerabilities, get paid, and make crypto safer.

通过与第三方的合作，我们将为社区建立一种方式，以帮助和提高所用智能合同的总体质量。潜在的第三方组织包括premier bug bounty platform for smart contracts和DeFi Project，在这些组织中，安全研究人员审查代码、披露漏洞、获得报酬，并使加密更安全。
