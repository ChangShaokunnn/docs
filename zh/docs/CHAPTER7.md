# 安全与风险Security & Risk

DeFi ecosystem is a new architecture and implies risks from multiple components with dependence among each other. Users have to understand the risks of projects and smart contracts before venturing into DeFi.  This section focuses on the risk associated with BOC and the interaction with the users, aiming to have transparency with higher risk standards created in the future development within BOC and the DeFi.

The following is a non-exhaustive list of security properties that were implemented.
* In order to avoid losses caused by code vulnerabilities, all protocols shall be audited by reputable auditors.
* In order to reduce the oracle attack vector, the quotation of the stable coin must be based on the Chain Link rather than the protocol itself.
* In order to avoid the chained system risks caused by nested tokens and Lego blocks, access to the BlockBank Ecosystem requires long-term safe operation records and community voting permission.
* In order to avoid losses caused by market fluctuations, the agreement to obtain financial returns by providing risk services is temporarily not connected.

The yield using BOC algo can be at risk including but not limited  to certain conditions that are applied.

DeFi生态系统是一种新的体系结构，意味着来自多个相互依赖的组件的风险。在进入DeFi之前，用户必须了解项目和智能合同的风险。本节重点关注与中国银行相关的风险以及与用户的互动，旨在通过在中国银行和DeFi的未来发展中制定更高的风险标准实现透明度。

以下是已实现的安全属性的非详尽列表。

* 为了避免代码漏洞造成的损失，所有协议都应由信誉良好的审计员进行审核。

* 为了减少Oracle攻击向量，稳定硬币的引用必须基于链接而不是协议本身。

* 为了避免嵌套代币和乐高积木造成的连锁系统风险，访问区块银行生态系统需要长期的安全操作记录和社区投票许可。

* 为了避免市场波动造成的损失，通过提供风险服务获得财务回报的协议暂时不关联。

使用BOC algo的收益率可能存在风险，包括但不限于应用的某些条件。

## 收益稀释风险Yield Dilution Risk

The increased liquidity from big whales can further dilute the yield of investing funds in a particular pool (being “backran”) during rebalancing intervals.

在重新平衡期间，来自大鲸鱼的流动性增加可能会进一步稀释在特定池中投资基金的收益率（被称为“回笼”）。

## 智能合约风险Smart Contract Risk

Smart contracts due to the complexities, even audited by the professional, can still post risk and are prone to hacks and unforeseeable events.

智能合同由于其复杂性，即使由专业人士审核，也可能会带来风险，并且容易受到黑客攻击和不可预见的事件。

## 市场风险Market Risk

The counterparty on the borrowers’ side lending protocols are also in default risk that cannot be rectified by liquidation in an extreme case of market fluctuation.

借款人方贷款协议中的交易对手也存在违约风险，在市场波动的极端情况下，无法通过清算予以纠正。

## 交易成本风险Transaction Cost Risk

The automatic rebalancing that was triggered by network congestion will result in high transaction fee (gas fee) and affects the final yield rate.

由网络拥塞引发的自动再平衡将导致较高的交易费用（汽油费），并影响最终收益率。
